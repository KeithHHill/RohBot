# RohBot

## Description
RohBot is a text based bot for the Discord app. It has simple functionality like flipping a coin and rolling a die. The commands are notated with a '!' like !command.

## Notes
The last line in RohBot.py requires editing to work. Either the constant inside client.run() can be replaced with your bot secret key or with an equivalent constant or function call.

The sql_setup function in RohBot.py only needs to be run on the first startup to create the database and user table.
