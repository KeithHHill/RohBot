# RohBot

## Description
RohBot is a text based bot for the Discord app. It has simple functionality like flipping a coin
 and rolling a die. The commands are notated with a '!' like !command.

## Notes
The last line in RohBot.py requires editing to work. Either the DiscordBotKey.KEY can be replaced
 with your bot secret key or with an equivalent call.
