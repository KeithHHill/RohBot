# RohBot

## Description
RohBot is a text based bot for the Discord app. It has simple functionality through commands like !flip or !roll (flip a coin, roll a die).

## Notes
- The last line in RohBot.py requires editing to work. Either the constant inside client.run() can be replaced with your bot secret key or with an equivalent constant/call.
- The sql_setup function in RohBot.py only needs to be run on the first startup to create the database and user table.
